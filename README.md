# Spectra Specification Language
This repository contains the Eclipse Xtext project for the Spectra language. In order to auto generate the language files from the xtext grammar:
- `git clone` the repository into your computer.
- Import the projects into an Eclipse workspace. After the clone you should have one folder, `spectra-lang`, containing many Java projects. Import all these projects by 'Import -> Projects from Folder or Archive', then choosing `spectra-lang` directory, selecting all the projects from there.
- Right click on `src/tau.smlab.syntech/GenerateSpectra.mwe2` and `Run As -> MWE2 Workflow`.

For further information about the Spectra synthesizer and language, please visit `spectra-synt` repository.
